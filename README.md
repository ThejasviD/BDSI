In this project, I analyzed genomic data for Low Grade Gliomas using pathway scores from The Cancer Genome Atlas. First, I focused on dimension reduction methods. These R files are for Truncated SVD, Kernel PCA, and t-SNE in a high-dimensional dataset (n=61, p=1283), achieving improved interpretability.
